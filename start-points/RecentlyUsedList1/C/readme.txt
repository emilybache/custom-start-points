This an implementation of a recently-used-list to hold pages uniquely in Last-In-First-Out order.

Convert the 'main' function into a unit test.

When you have done that, add more test cases until test coverage is 100% and you are happy the code works.

Expected functionality
----------------------

o) A recently-used-list is initially empty.

o) The most recently added item is first, the least recently added item is last.

o) Items can be looked up by index, which counts from zero.

o) Items in the list are unique, so duplicate insertions are moved rather than added.
