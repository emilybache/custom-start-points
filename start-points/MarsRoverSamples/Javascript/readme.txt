Mars Rover Sample Tests
=======================

Look through these test cases. They do not pass since the implementation is missing, but you should be able to read and evaluate them. Which are most likely to contain bugs? Which ones are easy to read and understand?

In pairs, discuss each test case. Pick the best and worst samples and report your findings to the group.
