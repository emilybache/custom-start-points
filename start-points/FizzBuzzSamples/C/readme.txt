Sample Fizzbuzz implementations
===============================

Some sample solutions to Fizzbuzz, to provoke discussion.

Discuss in pairs the following questions:

- If you were to implement the FizzBuzz kata, which of these implementations would your code end up most similar to?
- If you were to implement the FizzBuzz kata **using Test-Driven Development**, which of these implementations would your code end up most similar to?

After 10 minutes or so of discussion, each pair should report their chosen implementations. If you answer the two questions differently, explain why.

FizzBuzz requirements
---------------------

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Sample output:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
... etc up to 100
