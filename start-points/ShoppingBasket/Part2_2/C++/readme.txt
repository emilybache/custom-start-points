Calculate the price of a number of items in a shopping basket. 
Items have a price and a quantity.

The business rules have just been updated and the tests are currently failing. 

If you buy in bulk, you get a discount:
1. If total gross value > 150, and you bought more than one item, apply a 5% discount
2. If total gross value > 200, and you bought more than one item, apply a 7.5% discount
3. If total gross value > 300, and you bought only one item, apply a 10% discount
